An important part of Sentry is the way similar events are grouped together. This turns out to be a pretty complex issue, and it's not always obvious why events are being grouped the way they are.

Errors are aggregated (and deduplicated) based on the fingerprint of the event. By default Sentry will generate its own fingerprint, but you can also customize this behavior using `scope.set_fingerprint` or equivalent API in our SDKs. For example, in JavaScript this might look like this:

```javascript
function makeRequest(method, path, options) {
    return fetch(method, path, options).catch(err => {
        Sentry.withScope(scope => {
          // extend the fingerprint with the request path
          scope.setFingerprint(['{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}', path]);
          Sentry.captureException(err);
        });
    });
}
```

The default fingerprint is generated based on information available to Sentry within the event. (Such information is stored in [_interfaces_]({%- link _documentation/development/sdk-dev/interfaces.md -%}) such as `exception`, `stacktrace`, and `message`.) Fingerprints prioritize higher-value and more precise data when possible.

A simple way to understand the logic is:

-   If the interfaces used in an event differ, then those events will not be grouped together.
-   If a stack trace or exception is included in an event, then grouping will only consider this information.
-   (Uncommon) If the event involves a templating engine, then grouping will consider the template.
-   As a fallback, the message of the event will be used for grouping.

In our above example you'll note we included `{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}` in the fingerprint to *extend* the built-in behavior. If you wish to entirely override Sentry's logic you can specify your own set of parameters:


```javascript
function makeRequest(method, path, options) {
    return fetch(method, path, options).catch(err => {
        Sentry.withScope(scope => {
          // group errors together based on their request and response
          scope.setFingerprint([method, path, err.statusCode]);
          Sentry.captureException(err);
        });
    });
}
```

### Grouping by Stacktrace

When Sentry detects a stack trace in the event data (either directly or as part of an exception), the grouping is effectively based entirely on the stack trace. This grouping is fairly involved but easy enough to understand.

The first and most important part is that Sentry only groups by stack trace frames reported to be from your application. Not all SDKs report this, but if that information is provided, itâ€™s used for grouping. This means that if two stack traces differ only in parts of the stack that are not related to the application, they'll still be grouped together.

Depending on the information available, the following data can be used for each stack trace frame:

- Module name
- Normalized filename (with revision hashes, etc. removed)
- Normalized context line (essentially a cleaned up version of the sourcecode of the affected line, if provided)

This grouping usually works well, but two specific situations can throw it off if not dealt with:

- Minimized JavaScript sourcecode will destroy the grouping in really bad ways. Because of this you should ensure that Sentry can access your [Source Maps]({%- link _documentation/platforms/javascript/index.md -%}#source-maps).
- If you modify your stack trace by introducing a new level through the use of decorators, your stack trace will change and so will the grouping. To handle this, many SDKs support hiding irrelevant stack trace frames. (For example, the Python SDK will skip all stack frames with a local variable called `__traceback_hide__` set to _True_).

### Grouping By Exception

If no stack trace is available but exception info is, then the grouping will consider the `type` and `value` of the exception, as long as both pieces of data are present on the event. This grouping is a lot less reliable because of changing error messages.

### Fallback Grouping

If everything else fails, grouping falls back to messages. In this case the grouping algorithm will try to use the message without any parameters, but if that is not available, it will use the full message attribute.

## Customize Grouping with Fingerprints {#custom-grouping}

For some very advanced use cases you can override the Sentry default grouping using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be passed with the event information, and should be an array of strings. 

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special string `{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}` as one of the items (note that the double braces are important).

### Minimal example

This minimal example will put all exceptions of the current scope into the same issue/group:

{% include components/platform_content.html content_dir='set-fingerprint' %}

## Use Cases

### Group errors more granularly

Your application queries an RPC interface or external API service, so the stack trace is generally the same (even if the outgoing request is very different).

The following example will split up the default group Sentry would create (represented by `{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}`) further, taking some attributes on the error object into account:

{% include components/platform_content.html content_dir='fingerprint-rpc-example' %}

### Group errors more aggressively

A generic error, such as a database connection error, has many different stack traces and never groups together.

The following example will just completely overwrite Sentry's grouping by omitting `{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}` from the array:

{% include components/platform_content.html content_dir='fingerprint-database-connection-example' %}

## Grouping Algorithm Versioning

When you create a Sentry project, the latest and greatest version of the grouping algorithm is automatically selected. This means that the grouping behavior is consistent within a project. However, only new projects will see improvements in the grouping algorithm. If you want to upgrade an existing project to a new grouping algorithm version, you can do so in the project settings. Note that you can only upgrade. To downgrade, you will need to contact customer support. When upgrading you will very likely see new groups being created.

## Grouping Enhancements and Server Side Fingerprinting

When the default grouping does not yield satisfying results, there are ways in which the server can influence the grouping through grouping enhancements and server-side fingerprinting.

### Grouping Enhancements

If you use stack traces for grouping, the enhancements rules are used to influence the data.

Enhancements are rules written in a pretty straightforward way. Each line is a
single enhancement rule. It's one or multiple match expressions followed by one
or multiple actions to be executed when all expressions match. All rules are
executed from top to bottom on all frames in the stack trace.

The syntax for grouping enhancements is roughly like this:

```
matcher-name:expression other-matcher:expression ... action1 action2 ...
```

Here is a practical example to see how this looks like:

```
family:native function:std::*   -app
path:**/node_modules/**         -app
path:**/generated/**.js         -group
```

#### Rules

The following **matchers** exist. Multiple matchers can be defined in a line:

- `family`: matches on the general platform family. Right now there are `javascript`, `native` and `other`. To make a rule apply to multiple platforms, you can comma separate them.
  For example: `family:native,javascript` applies to both Javascript and Native.
- `path`: this matches case insensitive with Unix glob behavior on a path. The path separators are normalized to `/`. As a special rule, if the filename is relative, it still matches on `**/`. Examples:
  - `path:**/project/**.c`: matches on all files under `project` with a `.c` extension
  - `path:**/vendor/foo/*.c`: matches on vendor/foo without sub folders
  - `path:**/*.c`: matches on `foo.c` as well as `foo/bar.c`.
- `module`: is similar to `path` but matches on the module. This is not used for Native, but it is used for Javascript, Python, and similar platforms. Matches are case sensitive, and normal globbing is available.
- `function`: matches on a function, and is case sensitive with normal globbing.
- `function:myproject_*` matches all functions starting with `myproject_`
- `function:malloc` matches on the malloc function
- `package`: matches on a package. The package is the container that contains a function or module.
  This is a `.jar`, a `.dylib` or similar. The same matching rules as for `path` apply (For example, this is typically an absolute path).
- `app`: matches on the current state of the in-app flag. `yes` means the frame is in app, `no` means it's not.
- An expression can be quoted if necessary. For example, when spaces are included.

There are two types of **actions**: flag setting and setting variables.

- **flag**: flags are what is to be done if all matchers match. A flag needs to be prefixed with `+` to set it or `-` to unset it. If this expression is prefixed with a `^`, it applies to frames above the frame -- towards the crash. If prefixed with `v` it applies to frames below the frame -- away from the crash. For instance, `-group ^-group` removes the matching frame and all frames above that came from the grouping.
  - `app`: marks or unmarks a frame in-app
  - `group`: adds or removes a frame from grouping
- **variables**: additionally variables can be set (`variable=value`). Currently, there is just one:
  - `max-frames`: sets the total number of frames to be considered for grouping.
The default is `0` which means "all frames." If set to `3`, only the top 3 frames are considered.

If a line is prefixed with a hash (`#`), it's a comment and ignored.

#### Examples

```
path:**/node_modules/** -group
path:**/app/utils/requestError.jsx -group
path:**src/getsentry/src/getsentry/** +app

family:native max-frames=3

function:fetchSavedSearches v-group
path:**/app/views/**.jsx function:fetchData ^-group

family:native function:SpawnThread v-app -app
family:native function:_NSRaiseError ^-group -app
family:native function:std::* -app
family:native function:core::* -app
```

#### Recommendations

There are some general recommendations we have to greatly improve the out of the box grouping experience.

**Mark in-app Frames**

To proactively improve your experience, help Sentry determine which frames in your stack trace are "in-app" (part of your own application) and which ones are not. The default rules are defined by the SDK, but in many cases, this can be improved on the server as well. In particular, for languages where server-side processing is necessary (For example, Native C, C++, or JavaScript.) it's better to override this on the server.

For instance, the following marks all frames in-app that are below a specific C++ namespace:

```
function:myapplication::* +app
```

You can also achieve the inverse by just marking all frames "not in-app." However, if that's the case, you should ensure that first all frames are set to "in-app" to override the defaults:

```
app:no             +app
function:std::*    -app
function:boost::*  -app
```

Forcing all frames to be in-app first might be necessary as there might already have
been some defaults set by the client SDK or earlier processing.

**Cut Stack Traces**

In many cases, you want to chop off the top or bottom of the stack trace. For instance, many code bases use a common function to generate an error. In this case, the error machinery will appear as part of the stack trace. For example, if you use Rust, you likely want to remove some frames that are related to panic handling:

```
function:std::panicking::begin_panic       ^-app -app ^-group
function:core::panicking::begin_panic      ^-app -app ^-group
```

Here we tell the system that all frames, from begin-panic to the crash location, are not part of the application (including the panic frame itself). All frames above are also in all cases irrelevant for grouping.

Likewise, you can also chop off the base of a stack trace. This is particularly useful if you have different main loops that drive an application:

```
function:myapp::LinuxMainLoop         v-group -group
function:myapp::MacMainLoop           v-group -group
function:myapp::WinMainLoop           v-group -group
```

**Stack Trace Frame Limits**

This isn't useful for *all* projects, but it can work well for large applications with many crashes. The default strategy is to consider most of the stack trace relevant for grouping. This means that every different stack trace that leads to a crashing function will cause a different group to be created. If you do not want that, you can alternatively force the groups to be much larger by limiting how many frames should be considered.

For instance, you could tell the system only to consider the top N frames, if any of the frames in the stack trace refer to a common external library:

```
# always only consider the top 1 frame for all native events
family:native max-frames=1

# if the bug is in proprietarymodule.so, only consider top 2 frames
family:native package:**/proprietarymodule.so  max-frames=2

# these are functions we want to consider much more of the stack trace for
family:native function:KnownBadFunction1  max-frames=5
family:native function:KnownBadFunction2  max-frames=5
```

### Server Side Fingerprinting

Server-side fingerprinting is also configured with a config similar to grouping enhancements, but the syntax is slightly different. The matchers are the same but instead of flipping flags, a fingerprint is assigned that overrides the default grouping entirely.

```
(matcher:expression)+ -> list, of, values
```

All values are matched against, and in the case of stack traces, all frames are considered.
If all matches in a line match then the fingerprint is applied.

The matchers are the same as for grouping enhancements but some extra ones are available:

- `type`: matches on an exception type
- `value`: matches on an exception value
- `message`: matches on a log message

#### Examples

```
# force all errors of the same type to have the same fingerprint
type:DatabaseUnavailable -> system-down

# force all memory allocation errors to be grouped together
family:native function:malloc -> memory-allocation-error

# force all events with a certain message to be matched together
message:"unexpected i/o error: *" -> io-error
```
